What are data structures, and why are they important?\n","* Data structures are organized formats to store, manage, and manipulate data efficiently. In Python, they can be thought of as containers that hold and organize data for specific operations, making your programs more efficient and easier to understand.\n","      \n","  * Types of Data structures:\n","  List: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates.\n","  Tuple: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicates.\n","  Set: Unordered, mutable, no duplicate values.\n","  Dictionary: Key-value pairs, unordered, mutable.\n","  String: Immutable sequence of characters.\n","\n","  * Why are they important:\n","  Data structures help optimize operations like searching, sorting, and organizing data. Python's built-in data structures are highly user-friendly and come with extensive built-in methods using appropriate data structures simplifies code readability and maintainability. Many algorithms rely on specific data structures. It is efficiency, ease to use, problem solving, code clarity, scalability."],"metadata":{"id":"5JllbRmbAkwD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n"," * In Python, data types are classified as mutable or immutable based on whether their value can be changed after they are created.\n","\n"," a. Mutable data types:\n"," Definition: Mutable data types allow modifications to their contents without changing their identity.\n"," Ex: Lists, dictionaries, sets, byte arrays.\n","\n"," b. Immutable Data types:\n"," Definition: Immutable data types do not allow modification of their contents. Any operation that alters the value will create a new object in memory.\n"," Ex: Strings, tuples, integers, floats, booleans."],"metadata":{"id":"FEgTLcDGDKqB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","* Lists:\n","  1. Mutability(can be modified after creation) and uses more memory.\n","  2.

Describe how dictionaries store data?\n","  * In Python, dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hash table, where keys are hashed to determine their storage location, ensuring efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions, with collisions handled using techniques like open addressing or chaining. dictionaries are implemented using a hash table data structur.\n","   1. key-value pair storage:\n","     keys: string, numbers, tuples\n","     Values: any python object which can be mutable or immutable.\n","     Ex. my_dict = {\"name\": \"Vani\", \"age\": 20}\n","   2.

Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n"," * You might use a set instead of a list in Python when you need unique elements, faster membership testing, or to perform mathematical set operations, especially when the order of elements doesn't matter."],"metadata":{"id":"367025nqKrsV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n"," * A string in Python is an immutable sequence of characters, meaning once it is created, its contents cannot be changed, and it is used primarily for handling and manipulating text, with operations like slicing, concatenation, and various string-specific methods (e.g: .upper(), .replace()). In contrast, a list is a mutable sequence that can store elements of different data types (such as integers, strings, or other lists), and its contents can be modified, including adding, removing, or changing elements after its creation, making it more flexible for managing collections of items. While both strings and lists are sequences.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oTHPwVByL4eX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","  * Tuples ensure data integrity in Python through immutability, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be altered, added, or removed. This characteristic makes tuples ideal for situations where data consistency is critical. Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists, which is advantageous for storing large datasets where integrity and immutability are critical. Tuples signal to developers that the data is fixed and should not be modified, making code more predictable and easier to debug.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hgVyhItbPIqc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n"," * A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for fast data retrieval using a process called hashing. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, making them highly efficient for operations like lookups, insertions, and deletions. A hash function maps keys to hash values (integers), which determine the index (or bucket) where the key-value pair will be stored in the hash table.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-wXBRrDIQQHC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n"," * Yes, Python lists can contain different data types. They are heterogeneous, meaning you can store elements of various types in a single list."],"metadata":{"id":"PkyYzKYTbE1t"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n"," * Strings are immutable in Python because once a string object is created, its value cannot be modified.

Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n"," * No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable.

Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n"," * Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because the elements (key-value pairs) are not stored in a specific order.
